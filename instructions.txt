[HOW TO RUN THE CODE]

To use the diffdrive plugin you will need to start gazebo as a ros node, follow these instructions:
1 - Open a new terminal:
	$ roscore (this starts ros)
	
2 - Open a new terminal:
	$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:~/path-to-plugin/build (this is needed for the encoder and the CoG plugins)
	$ rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver (this starts the gazebo server)
	
3 - Open a new terminal
	$ rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient (this starts the gazebo gui)
	
4 - Insert the robotics_project model

To send the keyboard messages we use an existing node, open a new terminal and write the following instruction:
	$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
this opens a terminal where you can send command using the arrow keys

In the consolle you will see the angular velocity of the posterior wheels printed at 20Hz and the CoG printed when it changes (because it is related to the reference frame of the world). We suggest to run these two plugins separately (commenting the code) to have a clear output on the consolle.
